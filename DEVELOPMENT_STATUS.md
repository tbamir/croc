## üéØ Current GUI Features

### Your Peer ID Section
```
Your Peer ID: 1234-sweet-cat-tulip  [Copy]
Share this code with the other peer
```

### Connection Section
```
Enter code from other peer: [________________]
                           [Connect]
Status: Not Connected
```

### File Transfer Section
```
[Select Files/Folders to Send]  [Wait for Files]

Transfer Progress:
[==================] 45%
Current File: data_001.csv
Files Remaining: 15,234
```

## üîÑ How It Works Now

1. **User starts TrustDrop**
   - Automatically generates unique peer ID (e.g., "1234-sweet-cat-tulip")
   - Displays in prominent, copyable format

2. **Connection Process**
   - User shares their peer ID via secure channel (email, messaging)
   - Other user enters the peer ID in "Enter code from other peer"
   - Click "Connect" ‚Üí Status shows "Connecting..." ‚Üí "Connected to peer: [code]"

3. **File Transfer**
   - **Send Mode**: Click "Select Files/Folders to Send" ‚Üí Choose files ‚Üí Transfer starts
   - **Receive Mode**: Click "Wait for Files" ‚Üí Ready to receive from connected peer
   - Real-time progress tracking and status updates

## üöÄ Ready for Testing

The application is now ready for your two-machine testing scenario:

### Machine A (Sender):
1. Run `./trustdrop`
2. Copy the displayed peer ID
3. Share peer ID with Machine B user
4. Wait for Machine B to connect
5. Select files/folders to send

### Machine B (Receiver):
1. Run `./trustdrop`
2. Enter Machine A's peer ID
3. Click "Connect"
4. Click "Wait for Files" to receive
